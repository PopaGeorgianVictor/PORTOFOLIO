<summary>About me</summary>

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PrrBtXz4/Screenshot-4.png" width="90%">

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as electronic enginner and manual tester. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.I believe that so far I have formed a knowledge base, a way of thinking, which will help me to progress in my career in the future.
I am a punctual person with good communication skills, as a result I integrate extremely easily in a group. I like to learn different new things, to apply them and I can say that I am one of the people oriented towards evolution, progress, everything acquired through the accumulation of knowledge and skills.
I like to respond to the challenge of new situations because I am a dynamic, creative person, with a strategic and  communicative thinking.

 ## Methodologies

 A software development methodology is a series of procedures that describe how the team organizes itself in order to create a software product.
 
 There are several software development methodologies:
 
 * ### waterfall
 * ### agile
 * ### v - model
 
 ### Waterfall
 
<img src = "https://i.postimg.cc/CLY0ZSL2/Screenshot-1.png" width = "90%" >
 
 A software development methodology that involves the development of activities in the cascade (that is, the result of one stage represents input data for the next stage).It is a more rigid methodology that requires the completion of a stage completely before starting the next stage

* we finish the business requirements
* we finished the development
* we finished the testing
* we launch the product
 
 Disadvantages:

* if we want to change something in the middle of the development / testing process (that is, we changed our mind and want something else, or we want something additional) then a new project must be created that follows all the previous stages, with a separate budget and timeline
* the feedback from the client is received at the end and we will not have much time for adjustment


Benefits:

* we have an exact budget and we know from the beginning how much we will pay
* we know exactly how the product will look from the beginning
* we know when we have to finish creating / testing the product


 ### Agile
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zvCd8SvV/agile-777x437.png" width = "70%">

 
A software development methodology that involves developing the product in pieces in a series of mini-development projects.It is a more flexible methodology that allows changes and provides early feedback.

 Disadvantages:

* we don't know exactly how the product will look at the beginning (we have a sketch but we don't know exactly)
* if we don't know how the product will look, we don't even know how much it will cost us
* if we don't know how complex the product will be, we don't know exactly how long it will last
* if the team does not communicate well and there are conflicts in the team, the chances of the product failing increase considerably
* documentation is created, but briefer and only for essential things, which makes the need for essential communication
* it is not recommended when we have projects with a tight deadline or a limited budget

 Benefits:

* it is more flexible and allows making changes during the software development / testing process
* we receive early feedback related to the functionality of the product and have greater certainty about the final quality of the product from the point of view of the customer's needs

 Elements of the Agile methodology:

 * Backlog = All the elements that want to be implemented within a project
 * Backlog refinement = Filtering the functionalities that are not urgent or that are more difficult to implement for the benefit they bring and respectively the       clarification and detailing of the functionalities that remain to be implemented
* Sprint planning = Definition of all the functionalities that want to be implemented in a sprint
* Daizy Standup Meeting = Daily meetings that aim to identify:
* what was worked on the previous day
* what is being worked on now / today
* if there are blockers that prevent us from completing our tasks
* Sprint review = An analysis of all the functionalities that have been implemented and, respectively, moving the unimplemented functionalities to another sprint
* Retrospective sprints = Analysis of the progress of the sprint from the point of view of the things that were ok and must be kept and respectively from the point of view of the things that were not ok and must be improved.

Sprint = A period of time in which we undertake to implement a series of functionalities. As a rule, it is defined at an interval of two weeks, but it is at the discretion of the team
A project implemented in Agile consists of a sequence of sprints that each implement a piece of the product. The result of a sprint is called product increment (because it increases the number of functionalities ready to be used for our product)
 
 ## All about testing
 
### SDLC = Software Development Lifecycle
### STLC = Software Testing Lifecycle


1. Concept
2. Creation of business requirements
3. Development
4. STLC
 
a) Test planning
 
b) Test monitoring and control
 
c) Test analysis
 
d) Test design
 
e) Test implementation
 
f) Test execution
 
g) Completion test
 
5. Release
 
 
 ### Test Planning

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/qR27LLFQ/Screenshot-2.png">

 An administrative, preparatory stage of the entire testing process, which involves planning the testing activities and the testing process

* assigning roles (who will do the testing?)
* test plan (a document that describes how the testing will be carried out)
* we define the entry criteria and the exit criteria
* PROJECT risks are evaluated and mitigated if necessary
* the entry criteria are evaluated to check if we can go to the next stage of testing

### Define Test Criteria
 
 ####  Entry Criteria - definition on done
       
* conditions that must be met in order to start the testing process (all risks - or at least the major ones - have been mitigated, business requirements are defined, roles have been assigned, the test plan has been written and agreed upon by everyone)
 
 ####  Exit Criteria - definition on ready
 
* conditions that must be met in order to complete the testing process (let's run all the tests or a specific percentage, we've reached the deadline, we've finished the budget, we haven't found any bugs of high or very high severity in a certain interval of time, I haven't found any bugs at all in a certain period of time)


 
 ### Analize the product
 
 It is a stage in which:

a) the business requirements are analyzed to evaluate if they are correct, complete and if we can do testing following those business requirements. The purpose of this analysis (static testing) is to ensure the early detection of bugs and ensure a qualitative testing process
 
b) the test conditions (what we are testing) are defined starting from the previously defined business requirements
       
 * Who will use the website ?
 * What is it used for ?
 * How will it work ?
 * What are software/ hardware the product uses ?
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Bvz0KKQp/Screenshot-3.png">

 
 ###  Develop Test Strategy

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L63gBCpX/Screenshot-1.png">

 #### 1. Evaluate Situation
  
 * the components of the system to be tested are defined as “in scope“ -  Functional Testing, Api Testing
 * the components of the system that will not be tested also need to be clearly defined as being “out of scope.” -  Database Testing, hardware & any other external interfaces
 
 #### 2.  Identify Testing Type
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NFq08YnV/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 #### Test levels

1. Unit testing = the smallest functional piece of code (usually a function, a function that tests another function). It is usually done by developers

2. Component testing = checking the functionality of individual components in an application, not necessarily connected with other components (eX: checkout page). If a component depends on certain important functionalities that are not implemented, then it is possible to use some simulators (stubs / drivers)

3. Integration testing = checking how several components or systems communicate with each other

* Component integration testing (linking the product page with the checkout page)
* System integration testing (linking the e-commerce site with paypal)

4. System testing = checking the correctness of a complete functionality (end to end - e2e)

5. Acceptance testing = verification of the application from the point of view of the user and, respectively, of the fulfillment of his needs

* alpha testing = done at the supplier's headquarters by the testing team
* beta testing = it is done at the client's headquarters in a real environment or in an environment similar to the real one
 
 #### 3. Document Risk & Issues
 
 |Risk   | 	Mitigation  |
|-----:|---------------|
| Team member lack the required skills for website testing     |      Plan training course to skill up your members          |
|     The project schedule is too tight; it’s hard to complete this project on time |     Set test priority for each of the test activity        |
|    A lack of cooperation negatively affects your employees’ productivity   |      Encourage each team member in his task, and inspire them to greater efforts.       |
 |     Wrong budget estimate and cost overruns |          Establish the scope before beginning work, pay a lot of attention to project planning and constantly track and measure the progress    |

 #### 4. Create Test Logistics

 ##### 4.1 Who will test ?   
 
 * ability to understand customers point of view
 * strong desire for quality
 * attention to detail
 * good cooperation
 
 ##### 4.2 When will the test occur ?
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/P5kW4p9X/Screenshot-3.png">


  ###  Define Test Objective
  
  * checking that whether website  functionality is working as expected without any error or bugs in real business environment
  * check that the external interface of the website such as UI is working as expected and & meet the customer need
  * verify the usability of the website
 

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/WzXTQDjJ/Screenshot-1.png">

 
 ## Test Analysis & Design
  
   * reviewing the test basis (such as requirements, software integrity level1(risk level), risk analysis reports, architecture, design, interface specifications)
   * evaluating testability of the test basis and test objects
   * identifying and prioritizing test conditions based on analysis of test items, the specification, behavior and structure of the software
   * designing and prioritizing high level test cases
   * identifying necessary test data to support the test conditions and test cases
   * designing the test environment setup and identifying any required infrastructure and tools
   * creating bi-directional traceability between test basis and test cases
 

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/SKSG1tM1/test-analysis-v-model.webp" width = "70%">

 
 ## Test Implementations
 
 It is an administrative stage, preparatory to the execution stage in which we make sure that we have all the necessary information to be able to start the execution of the tests

In this stage we make sure that we have credentials (user and password), access, a prepared and functional test environment, the business requirements are analyzed and broken down in test conditions and tests, the tests are grouped into test suites, the identified test data is created in the previous stage (eg: if during the design test I identified that I have a user filtering test, in the implementation stage I will either create my users for filtering, or I will import them from an external file)


Test suite = a grouping of tests that have the same objective (functional tests, regression tests, non-functional tests, blackbox tests, whitebox tests, tests specific to a release, etc.)

The test suites have a different name depending on the application we use for testing (zephyr - test cycle, testrail - test suite, testlink - test plan, practitest - test library)


 
 * ensuring that the test environment is in place
 * ensuring every test case is well documented and reviewed
 * putting test environment in a state of readiness
 * checking against explicit and implicit entry criteria for the specified test level
 * describing test environment as well as test data in great detail
 * performing code acceptance check by running it on test environment
 
 
  ## Test Executation
 
 * the tests defined in the analysis stage are executed
 * test results are reported in a testing management tool (zephyr, alm, testrail, practitest, testlink, asana, bugzilla, mantis)
 * bug reports are opened for tests for which the expected result does not coincide with the current one
 * after fixing the bugs, retesting and regression testing is done
 * status reports are generated (daily status reports) which are periodically sent to the team leader and project manager


 
  * PASS: test procedure is executed and the expected result is satisfied
  * FAIL: test procedure is executed and the expected result is not satisfied
  * INCONCLUSIVE: test procedure is executed and requires further analysis to have a clear result
  * BLOCK: test procedure cannot be executed due to the fact that at least one of the test case preconditions are not met
  * DEFERED: test procedure is not executed yet and deferred for a future test cycle/release for execution
  * IN PROGRESS: test procedure is currently being executed
  

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gcZBZQq3/030e341-continuous-testing.jpg">

 
 ## Test Completion
 
 * the exit criteria are evaluated
 * unclosed residual bugs are closed
 * the test materials are archived (in practice this stage does not really exist)
 * test closing reports (test summary report / test completion report) are generated and sent to stakeholders
 * a test report is created = a document that contains the results of all the activities carried out during the testing process (who were the testers involved, what were the business requirements covered, the functionalities that were in scope / not in scope, how many tests we performed , how many were passed and how many were failed, how many bugs we found, how many are still open, if PRODUCT risks were identified, lessons learned, good practices)

 # Variables. Data Types 
 

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/yNydXyPt/Screenshot-7.png">

 
 * python variables are the containers that we store data values in them
 * when we assing this value, the variable is automatically created
 * we can assign a number, a string, a list, a tuple, a set, a dictionary  to python variables
 * we can change the value of a variable multiple times in our code
 * while we assign a value to the variables, if it is the same value, we can do this in one line
 * variables can be overwritten
 * data types are properties of variables, functions or methods that instruct the system about the stored value (for variables) or the returned result (for functions and    methods)

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zXwX0NJY/Screenshot-1.png">

 
## Basic rules for naming variables:

* it must start with a lowercase letter
* it must not have spaces - if the variable name consists of several words, then the variable name can follow the camelCase or snake_case format
* it must not start with numbers
* it must not start with special characters

# Operators
 
 ## There are different python operators. We can divide them into seven categories like below:
 
  
 * ### Arithmetic operators
 * ### Assignment operators
 * ### Comparison operators
 * ### Logical operators
 * ### Identity operators
 * ### Membership operators
 * ### Bitwise operators
 
 ##  Arithmetic operators

 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/4NHJ40yS/Screenshot-1.png">

 ## Assignment operators
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/pX81VNbr/Screenshot-1.png">
 
 ## Comparison operators
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Jtw63xJR/Screenshot-1.png">

 ## Logical operators
 
 ### To combine conditional statements, we use python logical operators. There are three logical operators in python. These are:
 
 * and operator returns True, if both statements are true
 * or operator returns True, if one of the statements is true
 * not operator reverse the result, returns False if the result is true
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/437mh1J8/317014639-5554931907888785-2170159366802940526-n.jpg">
 
 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/Dzn77dSJ/Screenshot-1.png">

 ## Identity operators
 
 ### Python Identity Operators are the operators that are used to compare the objects. This is not only a comparison about their value, but also their location in the memory. These operators check that if they are the same object or not. Below, you can find these Python Identity Operators
 
 * is operator checks that if both objects are the same object. If yes, it returns True
 * is not operator checks that if both objects are different objects. If yes, it returns True
 
 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/C1HNW8R4/Screenshot-1.png">
 
 ## Membership operators
 
 ### Python Membership Operators are used to check the members of a sequence. To do this, it uses two operators:
 
 * in operator returns True, if it finds the value as a member in the sequence
 * not in operator return True, if it do not find the value as a members in the sequence
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/htgRQkmy/Screenshot-1.png">

 ## Bitwise operators
 
 ### Lastly, we will talk about Bitwise operators of python. These operators are used to compare binary numbers in python programming
 
 * & AND   - Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
 * | OR    - Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
 * ^ XOR   -  Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 
 * ~ NOT   -  Inverts all the bits
 * '<<' Zero fill left shift  - Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
 * '>>' Signed right shift  - Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
 
 
 # Conditionals
 
 * in Python one of the most used statements is Python If Else or Python Else If statements
 * with these statements we check special conditions and according to this condition, we do something
 * the usage of this statements can be differently like below
 
 ## Indentation
 
 ### Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/rpvMPYG0/Screenshot-1.png">

 ## We can only use if statement :
 
 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/GtLbY9Hp/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/N0pRh2m6/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 ### We can use if and else statements together :
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BnDRS4n7/Screenshot-1.png">

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/J4Z7HwTv/Screenshot-1.png">

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zGdf8C2G/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/SxnBYcNs/Screenshot-1.png">
 
 ## We can use one or more elif with if and else statements :
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/029Zb4qn/Screenshot-1.png">
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d0WpQKfz/Screenshot-3.png">

 ## For Loop With If Statement 
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Gm09hWDg/Screenshot-4.png">

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9FQsw0dr/Screenshot-1.png">

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/c4ZtRKTM/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 ## Using And / Or Operators with Python If Else 
 
 * sometimes we need to check one more condition in the if statements(there are two operators that we us efor this purposes, one of them is “and”, the other one is “or”)
 * with “and” operator, we check the given conditions and if both the conditions are provided, then the body of the if statement runs
 * with “or” operator, we check the given conditions and if one of them is provided, then the body of the if statament runs
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vHg9HRPC/Screenshot-3.png">

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZRh2J9Gn/Screenshot-1.png">
 
 ## Nested If Statements
 
 * nested If Statements are the if statemetns used in another if statements
 * we can use multiple if statements inside another if statements
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zBscxyj8/Screenshot-1.png">
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FRNf3pt4/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YqKSW8Qy/Screenshot-3.png">

 
 ## Loops
 
 ### Python has two primitive loop commands:
     
 * while loops
 * for loops
 
### With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/13XLprx8/Screenshot-2.png">
 
### Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever
 
 
 ### With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true

 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wBcZzfLb/Screenshot-3.png">

 
 ### With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8PvV3bKx/Screenshot-4.png">

 ### With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wT1hd1LC/Screenshot-5.png">

 # Lists
 
 ## Basics
 
 * list is created with a Square Brackets []
 * the items belong to this list is added into these square brackets with commas (,)
 * list items are ordered(items have a defined order, and that order will not change) 
 * list items are changeable(we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created)
 * allow duplicate values(since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value)
 * list items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

 # Tuples
 
 ## Basics
 
 * can be created with round brackets
 * are used to store multiple items in a single variable
 * items are ordered(means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change)
 * are unchangeable(meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created)
 * items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
 * allow duplicates values

 ## Access Tuple Items
 
 ### We can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Xv8sDDFV/Screenshot-2.png">

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/63812f2t/Screenshot-3.png">

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NFDY56Ps/Screenshot-1.png">
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QxFnBgzf/Screenshot-2.png">

 
 ## Update
 
 * once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called
 * but there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4dkRNLwk/Screenshot-1.png">
 
 ### Since tuples are immutable, they do not have a build-in append() method, but there are other ways to add items to a tuple
   - convert into a list: Just like the workaround for changing a tuple, you can convert it into a list, add your item(s), and convert it back into a tuple
   - add tuple to a tuple. We are allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you want to add one item, (or many), create a new tuple with the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/htvX9vn4/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4dg4FND9/Screenshot-3.png">

 ### When creating a tuple with only one item, remember to include a comma after the item, otherwise it will not be identified as a tuple
 
 ## Remove
 
 ### Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can use the same workaround as we used for changing and adding tuple items

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nhFPT8Sh/Screenshot-4.png">
 
 ## Unpack
 
 * when we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple
 * but, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking"

 # Sets
 
 ## Basics
 
 * are written with curly brackets
 * are used to store multiple items in a single variable
 * are unordered(items in a set do not have a defined order, so we cannot be sure in which order the items will appear)
 * items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key
 * are unchangeable(that we cannot change the items after the set has been created, but we can remove items and add new items)
 * duplicates not allowed(cannot have two items with the same value, duplicate values will be ignored)

 ## Loop
 
 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/MKTNrVdV/Screenshot-11.png">

 ## Join
 
 ### We can use the union() method that returns a new set containing all items from both sets, or the update() method that inserts all the items from one set into another

 ## Methods

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fyJZ5sm4/Screenshot-1.png">

 # Functions
 
 ## Basics
 
 * a function is a block of code which only runs when it is called
 * we can pass data, known as parameters, into a function
 * a function can return data as a result
 * the advantage of using functions is given by code economy(we write them once and use them several times)
 * in the definition, what is between the brackets are called parameters
 * a parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition
 * when calling, what is between the brackets are called arguments
 * an argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called

 ### The components of a function
 
 * def -> marking the beginning of a function declaration
 * name of the function -> free text, it is recommended to be a suggestive name
 * function body -> instructions that will be executed once the function is called
 * parameters -> external information that the function may or may not need (optional)
 * return -> keyword through which we send the results of the function to the outsid
 * the body of the function is marked by indentation against the edge of the file

 ## Calling

 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/qMkMZHJh/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 ## Arguments/Parameters
 
 * information can be passed into functions as arguments
 * arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FRz35kgq/Screenshot-3.png">
 
 * ### by default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less

 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/0yB19LpN/Screenshot-4.png">

 ### Arbitrary Arguments, *args
 
 * if you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a * before the parameter name in the function definition
 * this way the function will receive a tuple of arguments, and can access the items accordingly

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ZR3BhGMk/Screenshot-5.png">

 ### Keyword Arguments
 
 * we can also send arguments with the key = value syntax
 * this way the order of the arguments does not matter
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/50wBmQ1F/Screenshot-6.png">

  ### Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs
  
  * if we do not know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function, add two asterisk: ** before the parameter name in the function definition
  * this way the function will receive a dictionary of arguments, and can access the items accordingly
  
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/yxR8R0zw/Screenshot-7.png">
 
  ### Passing a List as an Argument
 
 * we can send any data types of argument to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), and it will be treated as the same data type inside the function
  
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zDkJsDGw/Screenshot-9.png">

 ### Default Parameter Value
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2ygBRzzf/Screenshot-8.png">
 
 ## Return 
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zDkJsDGw/Screenshot-9.png">

 ## The pass Statement
 
 * function definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a function definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

  # Classes/Objects 

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/902PLrW8/Screenshot-1.png">

  ## Basics
 
  * object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects
  * a class is a blueprint(sketch) for the object
  * an object (instance) is an instantiation of a class(when class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated)
  * an object has two characteristics : attributes(for examples name,age,color) and methods(for examples singing, dancing)
  * the central pillar of OOPs - data Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
  
  
  ## Create a Class
  
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tRwCdXwG/Screenshot-1.png">

  ## Create Object
  
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Y0B7VxFN/Screenshot-2.png">

  ## The __init__() Function
  
* the examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications
* o understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function
* all classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated
* use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created
* this function also called constructor  
  
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/76n4F2np/Screenshot-3.png">
 
 ### Note: Te __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object
 
  ## The __str__() Function
  
  * the __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string
  * if the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned
  
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4x1V88DG/Screenshot-4.png">
 
  ## Object Methods
  
  * objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object
  * let's go and create a method in the Person class
  
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L5z3mmbY/Screenshot-5.png">
 
 ### Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class
 
 ## The self Parameter
 
 * the self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class
 * it does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gJpv4CJG/Screenshot-6.png">
 
 ## Modify Object Properties

 # The Four Pillars
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/50bq3X9P/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 ## Inheritance
 
 * inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class
 * parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class
 * child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/PxPRtqc5/Screenshot-1.png">
 
 ### Create a Child Class
 
 * to create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nzq20Q9g/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 ### Add the __init__() Function
 
 * so far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from its parent
 * we want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of the pass keyword)
 * the __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/SKh4NHbM/Screenshot-3.png">
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sgtYB9TS/Screenshot-4.png">

 
 ### Add properties
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/NfnJ4XNG/Screenshot-5.png">
 
 ### Add methods
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/WzT6NG2V/Screenshot-6.png">
 
 * if we add a method in the child class with the same name as a function in the parent class, the inheritance of the parent method will be overridden
 
 ### Types of Inheritance
 
  * Single Inheritance : enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single-parent class
  * Multilevel Inheritance : enables a derived class to inherit properties from an immediate parent class which in turn inherits properties from his parent class
  * Hierarchical Inheritance  : enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class
  * Multiple Inheritance : enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Gh6b8qyb/Screenshot-1.png">

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Z5Z4x0VQ/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 ## Polymorphism
 
 * means having many forms
 * defines methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class
 * it means that the same function name can be used for different types
 
 ### With Function and Objects
 
 * we can create a function that can take any object, allowing for polymorphism
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/5t6Y5MdY/Screenshot-1.png">
 
 ### With Class Methods
 
 * we have to create a for loop that iterates through a tuple of objects
 * next, you have to call the methods without being concerned about which class type each object is. We assume that these methods actually exist in each class
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/65hfYRqk/Screenshot-2.png">

 ### With Inheritance
 
 * in inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. Also, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class
 * this is mostly used in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesn’t fit the child class. This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as Method Overriding
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/sgnVsnH3/Screenshot-3.png">

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nVTSd6XV/Screenshot-4.png">
 
 ## Encapsulation
 
 * it describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit
 * this puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data
 * prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method
 * the access modifiers : public(is accessible from inside or outside the class), private(is accessible only inside class, prefixing the member name with two underscores), protected(is accessible from inside the class and its sub-class, prefixing the member name with an underscore)
 
 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/qM7pL1Vf/Screenshot-8.png">

 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/SswNYq5y/Screenshot-6.png">

 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/2S8T3BZ7/Screenshot-9.png">

 
  ## Abstraction
 
 * is used to hide the irrelevant data/class in order to reduce the complexity
 * is essential to hide the core functionality from the users
 * an Abstract class can contain the both method normal and abstract method
 * an Abstract cannot be instantiated; we cannot create objects for the abstract class

 # SELENIUM

 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/26hNCd22/Screenshot-12.png">
 
 ## Navigating 
 
 The first thing we’ll want to do with WebDriver is navigate to a link. The normal way to do this is by calling get method:
 
 * #### driver.get("url")
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Cx1CxPFJ/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 ## Locating Elements
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/2SDsxBjZ/Screenshot-1.png">

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YShjtVck/Screenshot-2.png">

 ### To find an element:
 
 * find_element
 
 ### To find multiple elements (these methods will return a list):
 
 * find_elements
 
 ### ID
 
* the most popular way to identify web element is to use ID. ID’s are considered as the safest and fastest locator option and should always be the first priority among the multiple locators
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MTkt9k8Q/Screenshot-1.png">

 ### Name 
 
 * this is also an effective way to locate an element which has a name attribute. With this strategy, the first element with the value of the name attribute will be returned. If no element has a matching name attribute, then a  NoSuchElementException will be raised
 
  
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MH0Wn8zb/Screenshot-2.png">

 
 ### LinkText & ParialLinkText
 
 * you can identify the hyperlinks on a web page using this linkText. It can be determined with the help of an anchor tag (<a>). In order to create the hyperlinks on a web page, you can use the anchor tags followed by the link text. In some cases, you may need to find links by a portion of the text in a linkText element. In such situations, you can use Partial Link Text to locate elements
 
 
 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/0NJ16qfM/Screenshot-3.png">

 ### Tag Name
 
 * use this when you want to locate an element by tag name. With this strategy, the first element with the given tag name will be returned. If no element has a matching tag name, a NoSuchElementException will be raised
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bJHMbY2J/Screenshot-4.png">
 
 ### Class Name
 
 * use this when you want to locate an element by class name. With this strategy, the first element with the matching class name attribute will be returned. If no element has a matching class name attribute, a NoSuchElementException will be raised

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Bb7mcjZq/Screenshot-5.png">

 ### CSS Selectors
 
 #### CSS is mainly used to provide style rules for the web pages and you can use it for identifying one or more elements in the web page. The CSS selector is always the best possible way to locate complex elements in the page. With this strategy, the first element matching the given CSS selector will be returned. If no element matches the provided CSS selector, a NoSuchElementException will be raised
 
 * css selector best selector after ID
 * fast for selenium next to ID
 * easy to write
 * better than xpath (even tho u hear the word so much more !!!)
 
 #### Simply use id or class as css locator
 
 * '.' is for class
 * '#' is for id
 
 #### Example find the nav bar
 
 * css using id = #site-navigation
 * css using id = nav#site-navigation
 * css using class = .main-navigation
 * css using class = nav.main-navigation
 
 #### CHILD ELEMENT 
 
 * can chain css with '>' or ' ' (space) to find child elements.
 * '>' for direct decendent
 * '*' ' ' for any child/subchild
 * next two should give same result
 
 #### Multiple Classes 
 
 * just connect all classes with '.'
 
 #### Partialy matching attribute 
 
 *  '*' contains word
 *  ^ start with word
 *  $ ends with word * 
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YCCWBdxy/Screenshot-6.png">
 
### XPath
 
* XPath is the language used for locating nodes in an XML document. As HTML can be an implementation of XML (XHTML), Selenium users can leverage this powerful language to target elements in their web applications. XPath supports the simple methods of locating by id or name attributes and extends them by opening up all sorts of new possibilities such as locating the third checkbox on the page

* one of the main reasons for using XPath is when you don’t have a suitable id or name attribute for the element you wish to locate. You can use XPath to either locate the element in absolute terms (not advised), or relative to an element that does have an id or name attribute. XPath locators can also be used to specify elements via attributes other than id and name

* absolute XPaths contain the location of all elements from the root (html) and as a result are likely to fail with only the slightest adjustment to the application. By finding a nearby element with an id or name attribute (ideally a parent element) you can locate your target element based on the relationship. This is much less likely to change and can make your tests more robust

 * // relative xpath
 * / absolute xpath

* //tag[@attribute='value']
* //*[@attribute='value']

 ## Interacting with Webpage
 
 ### Performing click event : 
 
 * the click() method is used to perform click operation on any web element
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RhQxdQ6c/Screenshot-1.png">

 ### Sending inputs : 
 
 * the send.keys('text') method is used to  enter text into a field
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YqZz8K7z/Screenshot-2.png">
 
 ### Clearing inputs : 
 
 * the clear() method is used to clear the inputs from the text box
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/SQXr9xFx/Screenshot-3.png">
 
 ### Navigating backward/forward in browser history : 
 * the back() method is used to return to previous page 
 * the forward() method is used to go to the next page
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FRkLY1dt/Screenshot-4.png">

 ### Refresh/reload a web page : 
 * the refresh() method is used to reload page
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0yr2kFKF/Screenshot-5.png">
 
 ### Closing browser : 
 * the close() method is used to close current tab and quit() is used to close all tabs
 
 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/hjnBd5hS/Screenshot-6.png">

 ### Maximize web window :
 * the maximize_window() method is used to maximize web window

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/44MW2hbc/Screenshot-7.png">
 
 # Waits 
 
 * most of the web apps are using AJAX techniques. When a page is loaded by the browser, the elements within that page may load at different time intervals. This makes locating elements difficult: if an element is not yet present in the DOM, a locate function will raise an ElementNotVisibleException exception. Using waits, we can solve this issue. Waiting provides some slack between actions performed - mostly locating an element or any other operation with the element
 * selenium Webdriver provides two types of waits - implicit & explicit. An explicit wait makes WebDriver wait for a certain condition to occur before proceeding further with execution. An implicit wait makes WebDriver poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to locate an element.
 
 <img  src="https://i.postimg.cc/vZx4YBvF/Screenshot-1.png">

 ## Implicit Waits
 
 * an implicit wait tells WebDriver to poll the DOM(Document Object Model) for a certain amount of time when trying to find any element (or elements) not immediately available. The default setting is 0. Once set, the implicit wait is set for the life of the WebDriver object
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/t4PRnPDN/Screenshot-8.png">

 ## Explicit Waits
 
 * an explicit wait is a code you define to wait for a certain condition to occur before proceeding further in the code. The extreme case of this is time.sleep(), which sets the condition to an exact time period to wait. There are some convenience methods provided that help you write code that will wait only as long as required. WebDriverWait in combination with ExpectedCondition is one way this can be accomplished

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/brxCbpPm/Screenshot-1.png">

 #### This waits up to 10 seconds before throwing a TimeoutException unless it finds the element to return within 10 seconds. WebDriverWait by default calls the ExpectedCondition every 500 milliseconds until it returns successfully.
 
#### Some of expected condition

*  title_is
*  title_contains
*  presence_of_element_located
*  visibility_of_element_located
*  visibility_of
*  presence_of_all_elements_located
*  element_located_to_be_selected
*  element_selection_state_to_be
*  element_located_selection_state_to_be
*  alert_is_present

# BDD-POM

 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bvqGjZp3/1-V3-Cy-C87v-5oj6icm-Weu-fg.jpg">

### BDD: Behavior Driven Development

A software development approach centered on test scenarios based on the client's functional expectations for the application

When we develop an application with BDD, things will unfold as follows:

1. We define the test scenarios in a common language, usually English, to be understood by all participants and people involved in the project. The test scenarios will be written in a language called Gherkin

2. We define the automatic tests to cover the scenarios defined above. We run the tests, and the expectation is that they will fail, because the code has not been written yet

3. We write the code to implement the application starting from the automatic tests written previously, we run the tests again and this time the expectation is that those tests will be passed

4. If there are failed tests, then we will report bugs, which will later be fixed, and then we will resume the process of running the tests

5. Repeat step 4 until all tests are passed

Benefits:

1. Anyone who looks over our suite of automated tests will easily understand what we tested and which functionalities of the application were covered
2. The focus / attention shifts to test scenarios, so the chances of ensuring the quality of the application increase

BDD is an approach derived from TDD (Test Driven Development)
TDD = A software development approach centered on automated tests written for application testing
 
When we develop an application with BDD, things will unfold as follows:
 
 1. We define the automatic tests to cover the business functionalities requested by the client. We run the tests, and the expectation is that they will fail, because the code has not been written yet

2. We write the code to implement the application starting from the automatic tests written previously, we run the tests again and this time the expectation is that those tests will be passed

3. If there are failed tests, then we will report bugs, which will later be fixed, and then we will resume the process of running the tests

4. Repeat step 3 until all tests are passed
 
The difference between TDD and BDD is that in BDD the emphasis is on scenarios (that is, starting from scenarios), in TDD the emphasis is on tests (that is, starting from tests).
* in addition to TDD, BDD has the description of business scenarios in the Gherkin language saved in some files called feature files
* in python, the BDD is implemented through the behave library
* in Java (possibly also other languages) the BDD is implemented through the cucumber library

A feature file consists of the following components:

1. Feature to be tested = A larger functionality composed of several sub-functionalities
2. Scenario = A use case / an action or set of actions that the user does and that lead to a certain result
3. Scenario steps = Instructions / individual actions that the user does to obtain a certain result
 
 #### Gherkin = A descriptive language that is used to map automated tests with an easy-to-understand business description by all project participants, even if they have no    technical knowledge

It is based on several keywords:

 * feature = a major functionality that can be tested
 * scenario = a specific scenario / an action or series of actions that the user does to obtain a benefit
 * scenario outline = a more complex scenario with several input options
 * given = the context in which the action takes place
 * when = the actions that the user does
 * then = the result we expected to receive when performing the above actions
 * background = steps of type given that are valid for several scenarios (to avoid code duplication)



### POM: Page Object Model

Page Object Model = a design pattern that has the role of structuring the elements that want to be searched in a web page depending on the page they are on, with the aim of organizing them better and being easier to identify.Any page in a website will have a correspondent in a python file mapping the elements and actions to be tested.
Any mapped page will be embodied in a class that will contain attributes for elements and methods for actions.
 
#### Design pattern = a generally valid structure that was defined to solve a specific and generally encountered problem

Examples of design patterns:

* page object model
* data-driven testing
* key-driven testing
* singleton

 # SQL 
 
 ## WHAT IS A DATABASE
 
 A database is an integrated collection of logically related records or files consolidated into a common pool that provides data for one or more multiple uses.The data in a database is organized according to a database model.
 
## RELATIONAL DATABASES
 
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kGm96q1X/Screenshot-2.png" width = "70%">
 
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/59BsWLzF/Screenshot-3.png" width = "70%">
 
 ### RELATIONAL DATABASE STRUCTURE
 
 #### THREE KEY TERMS ARE USED EXTENSIVELY IN RELATIONAL DATABASE MODELS: RELATIONS,ATTRIBUTES, AND DOMAINS.
* a relation is a table with columns and rows
* the named columns of the relation are called attributes
* The domain is the set of values the attributes are allowed to take
 
#### THE BASIC DATA STRUCTURE OF THE RELATIONAL MODEL IS THE TABLE, WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT A PARTICULAR ENTITY (SAY, AN EMPLOYEE) IS REPRESENTED IN ROWS (ALSO CALLED TUPLES) AND COLUMNS
* the "relation" in "relational database" refers to the various tables in the database
* a relation is a set of rows
* the columns enumerate the various attributes of the entity (the employee's name, address or phone number, for example).
* a row is an actual instance of the entity (a specific employee) that is represented by the relation
* as a result, each tuple of the employee table represents various attributes of a single employee
 
 ### TABLES, RELATIONSHIPS,CARDINALITY
 
 #### ALL RELATIONS (AND, THUS, TABLES) IN A RELATIONAL DATABASE HAVE TO ADHERE TO SOME BASIC RULES TO QUALIFY AS RELATIONS.
* the ordering of columns is immaterial in a table.
* there can't be identical tuples or rows in a table.
* each tuple will contain a single value for each of its attributes.
 
#### A RELATIONAL DATABASE CONTAINS MULTIPLE TABLES, EACH SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN THE"FLAT" DATABASE MODEL.ANY VALUE OCCURRING IN TWO DIFFERENT RECORDS (BELONGING TO THE SAME TABLE OR TO DIFFERENT TABLES), IMPLIES A RELATIONSHIP AMONG THOSE TWO RECORDS.IN ORDER TO ENFORCE EXPLICIT INTEGRITY CONSTRAINTS, RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RECORDS IN TABLES CAN ALSO BE DEFINED EXPLICITLY, BY IDENTIFYING OR NON-IDENTIFYING PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS CHARACTERIZED BY ASSIGNING CARDINALITY.
* 1:1 – usually when a table contains a lot of columns and is used to split is a table in two in
order to optimize access or limit the visibility of some information
* 1:n - a department has a number of employees
* m:n - each employee has a number of children
 
 ### KEYS
 
 #### TABLES CAN ALSO HAVE A DESIGNATED SINGLE ATTRIBUTE OR A SET OF ATTRIBUTES THAT CAN ACT AS A "KEY", WHICH CAN BE USED TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY EACH TUPLE IN THETABLE.A KEY THAT CAN BE USED TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY A ROW IN A TABLE IS CALLED A PRIMARY KEY. KEYS ARE COMMONLY USED TO JOIN OR COMBINE DATA FROM TWO OR MORE TABLES. A KEY THAT HAS AN EXTERNAL, REAL-WORLD MEANING (SUCH AS A PERSON'S CNP, A BOOK'S ISBN, OR A CAR'S SERIAL NUMBER) IS SOMETIMES CALLED A "NATURAL" KEY. IN PRACTICE, MOST DATABASES HAVE BOTH GENERATED AND NATURAL KEYS:
* generated keys can be used internally to create links between rows that cannot break
* natural keys can be used, less reliably, for searches and for integration with other databases
* for example, records in two independently developed databases could be matched up by
CNP, except when the social security numbers are incorrect, missing, or have changed
 
 
 ### DATABASE INTEGRITY,CONSTRAINTS
 
#### CONSTRAINTS ALLOW US TO DEFINE THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN AUTOMATICALLY ENFORCE THE INTEGRITY OF A DATABASE. CONSTRAINTS DEFINE RULES REGARDING PERMISSIBLE VALUES ALLOWED IN COLUMNS AND ARE THE STANDARD MECHANISM FOR ENFORCING INTEGRITY.
 TYPES OF CONSTRAINTS: 
* Domain Constraints: A Domain constraint deals with one or more columns. It is important to ensure that a particular column or a set of columns meets particular criteria. When you insert or update a row, the constraint is applied without respect to any other row in the table. The focus is on the data that is in the column(Check constraints, Default constraints).
* Entity Constraints: Entity constraints are all about individual rows. This constraint ignores the column as a whole and focuses on a particular row. This can be best exemplified by a constraint that requires every row to have a unique value for a column or a combination of columns.This is to ensure that for a particular row, the same value does notalready exist in some other row (Primary key and Unique constraints).
* Referential Integrity Constraints: Referential integrity constraints are created when a value in one column must match the value in another column. It can either be in the same table or more typically, a different table.
 
 ### REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY
 
 REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY IS A DATABASE CONCEPT THAT ENSURES THAT <strong> RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TABLES REMAIN CONSISTENT</strong>. WHEN ONE TABLE HAS A FOREIGN KEY TO ANOTHER TABLE, THE CONCEPT OF REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY STATES THAT YOU MAY NOT ADD A RECORD TO THE TABLE THAT CONTAINS THE FOREIGN KEY UNLESS THERE IS A CORRESPONDING RECORD IN THE LINKED TABLE.
* A <strong>FOREIGN KEY</strong> IS A REFERENTIAL CONSTRAINT BETWEEN TWO TABLES.
* THE FOREIGN KEY IDENTIFIES <i> A COLUMN OR A SET OF COLUMNS IN ONE (REFERENCING) TABLE THAT REFERS TO A COLUMN OR SET OF COLUMNS IN ANOTHER (REFERENCED)TABLE</i>.
* THE COLUMNS IN THE REFERENCING TABLE MUST BE THE PRIMARY KEY OR OTHER CANDIDATE KEY IN THE REFERENCED TABLE. THE VALUES IN ONE ROW OF THE REFERENCING COLUMNS MUST OCCUR IN A SINGLE ROW IN THE REFERENCED TABLE.
* A ROW IN THE REFERENCING TABLE CANNOT CONTAIN VALUES THAT DON'T EXIST IN THE REFERENCED TABLE (EXCEPT POTENTIALLY NULL).
* THE REFERENCING AND REFERENCED TABLE MAY BE THE SAME TABLE. A TABLE MAY HAVE MULTIPLE FOREIGN KEYS, AND EACH FOREIGN KEY CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT REFERENCED TABLE.
* <strong>CASCADING UPDATE AND CASCADING DELETE</strong> ENSURE THAT CHANGES MADE TO THE LINKED TABLE ARE REFLECTED IN THE PRIMARY TABLE.
 
 ### DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE
 
 * SQL = STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE
 * SQL COMMANDS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO MAIN SUBLANGUAGES.
 <strong>The Data Definition Language (DDL) </strong> contains the commands used to create and destroy databases and database objects. After the database structure is defined with DDL,
 database administrators and users can utilize the <strong>Data Manipulation Language</strong> to insert, retrieve and modify the data contained within it.
 
#### THERE ARE THREE BASIC DDL COMMANDS:
 
#### CREATE
#### ALTER
#### DROP
 
 ### DDL - CREATE STATEMENT
 
 * THE CREATE COMMAND CAN BE USED TO ESTABLISH EACH OF THESE DATABASES ON YOUR PLATFORM. FOR EXAMPLE, <strong>THE COMMAND: CREATE DATABASE EMPLOYEES</strong> ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO CREATE DATABASES IS USING THE UI OPTIONS SUPPORTED BY MICROSOFT SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO.
* AFTER CREATING THE DATABASE, YOUR NEXT STEP IS TO CREATE TABLES THAT WILL CONTAIN DATA. ANOTHER VARIANT OF THE CREATE COMMAND CAN BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.
 
#### CREATE TABLE table_name
#### (
#### column_name1 data_type,
#### column_name2 data_type,
#### column_name3 data_type,
#### ....
#### )
 
* THE TABLE COLUMNS ARE DEFINED USING THREE BASIC PROPERTIES:
* Column name
* Data type
* Nullability
#### TEMPORARY TABLES ARE A USEFUL TOOL IN SQL SERVER PROVIDED TO ALLOW FOR SHORT TERM USE OF DATA. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF TEMPORARY TABLE IN SQL SERVER, LOCAL AND GLOBAL. BOTH TYPES OF TEMPORARY TABLES ARE CREATED IN THE SYSTEM DATABASE TEMPDB.
 
 <strong>Local temporary tables</strong> are only available to the current connection to the database for the current user and are dropped
when the connection is closed.
 <strong>Global temporary tables</strong> are available to any connection once created and are dropped when the last connection using it is closed.
To make the table a local temporary table, you simply prefix the name with a (#). To make the table a global temporary
table, prefix it with (##).
 
 #### DDL - ALTER STATEMENT
 
* ONCE YOU'VE CREATED A TABLE WITHIN A DATABASE, YOU MAY WISH TO MODIFY THE DEFINITION OF IT. THE ALTER COMMAND ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE OF A TABLE WITHOUT DELETING AND RECREATING IT. 
 
 <strong>ALTER TABLE PERSONAL_INFO ADD SALARY MONEY NULL</strong>
 
* THIS EXAMPLE ADDS A NEW ATTRIBUTE TO THE PERSONAL_INFO TABLE -- AN EMPLOYEE'S SALARY. THE "MONEY" ARGUMENT SPECIFIES THAT AN EMPLOYEE'S SALARY WILL BE STORED USING A DOLLARS AND CENTS FORMAT. FINALLY, THE "NULL" KEYWORD TELLS THE DATABASE THAT IT'S OK FOR THIS FIELD TO CONTAIN NO VALUE FOR ANY GIVEN EMPLOYEE.
 
 
 #### DDL - DROP STATEMENT
 
 * THE FINAL COMMAND OF THE DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE, DROP, ALLOWS US TO REMOVE ENTIRE DATABASE OBJECTS FROM OUR DBMS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE WANT TO PERMANENTLY REMOVE THE PERSONAL_INFO TABLE THAT WE CREATED, WE'D USE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND: <strong>DROP TABLE PERSONAL_INFO</strong>
* SIMILARLY, THE COMMAND BELOW WOULD BE USED TO REMOVE THE ENTIRE EMPLOYEES DATABASE: <strong>DROP DATABASE DB_NAME</strong>

 ## SQL SERVER OBJECTS
 
* ####  TABLES
* <strong>VIEWS</strong> - ARE NOTHING BUT SAVED SQL STATEMENTS, AND ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED AS “VIRTUAL TABLES”. KEEP IN MIND THAT VIEWS CANNOT STORE RATHER THEY ONLY REFER TO DATA PRESENT IN TABLES.
 * <strong>STORED PROCEDURES</strong> - IS AN ALREADY WRITTEN SQL STATEMENT THAT IS SAVED IN THE DATABASE. IF YOU FIND YOURSELF USING THE SAME QUERY OVER AND OVER AGAIN, IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO PUT IT INTO A STORED PROCEDURE. WHEN YOU PUT THIS SQL STATEMENT IN A STORED PROCEDURE, YOU CAN THEN RUN THE STORED PROCEDURE FROM THE DATABASE'S COMMAND ENVIRONMENT USING EXEC COMMAND.
 * <strong>FUNCTIONS</strong> - A USER-DEFINED FUNCTION IS AN ALREADY WRITTEN SQL STATEMENT THAT ACCEPTS PARAMETERS, PERFORMS AN ACTION, SUCH AS A COMPLEX CALCULATION, AND RETURNS THE RESULT OF THAT ACTION AS A VALUE.
 
 ## CREATING AND ALTERING A TABLE
 
 ### CREATE TABLE
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/6qHhyLtW/1.png" width="70%">
 
 #### CREATE TABLE "TABLE_NAME"
 
(
"column 1" "data_type_for_column_1",
"column 2" "data_type_for_column_2",
... )
 
 
 • SO, IF WE ARE TO CREATE THE <strong>ANGAJAT</strong> TABLE SPECIFIED AS ABOVE, WE WOULD TYPE IN: 

#### CREATE TABLE ANGAJAT (ID_ANGAJAT INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
 
##### NUME VARCHAR(50), 
 
##### LOCALITATE_ID INT,
 
##### CASATORIT TINYINT,
 
##### DATA NASTERII DATE)
 
 ### ALTER TABLE
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7YGz3yNM/2.png" width="70%">
 
 <strong>ADD A COLUMN /CONSTRAINT/INDEX:</strong> ALTER TABLE ANGAJAT ADD SALAR DECIMAL (18,2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT DF_ANGAJAT_SALAR DEFAULT(0)
 
 <strong>DROP A COLUMN /CONSTRAINT/INDEX:</strong> ALTER TABLE ANGAJAT DROP COLUMN SALAR
 
 <strong>CHANGE A COLUMN /CONSTRAINT/INDEX:</strong> ALTER TABLE ANGAJAT ALTER COLUMN DATANASTERII DATETIME NOT NULL
 
 <strong>CHANGE THE DATA TYPE FOR A COLUMN:</strong> ALTER TABLE ANGAJAT ALTER COLUMN NUME NVARCHAR(100)
 
 
 ## PRIMARY KEY 
 
 <img src = "https://i.postimg.cc/R0bWsB5R/5.png">
 
 <img src = "https://i.postimg.cc/3N9513zr/6.png">
 
 ## FOREIGN KEY
 
 <img src = "https://i.postimg.cc/X70kcwgv/7.png">
 
 
 
 ### CONSTRAINS
 
 <strong>NOT NULL CONSTRAINT:</strong> ENSURES THAT A COLUMN CANNOT HAVE NULL VALUE. ALTER TABLE ANGAJAT ALTER COLUMN DATANASTERII DATETIME NOT NULL
 
 <strong>DEFAULT CONSTRAINT:</strong> PROVIDES A DEFAULT VALUE FOR A COLUMN WHEN NONE IS SPECIFIED. ALTER TABLE [DBO].[ANGAJAT] ADD CONSTRAINT [DF_ANGAJAT_CASATORIT] DEFAULT ((1)) FOR [CASATORIT] ALTER TABLE [DBO].[ANGAJAT] DROP CONSTRAINT [DF_ANGAJAT_CASATORIT]
 
 <strong>UNIQUE CONSTRAINT:</strong> ENSURES THAT ALL VALUES IN A COLUMN ARE DIFFERENT. 

ALTER TABLE [DBO].[ANGAJAT] ADD CONSTRAINT [LK_ANGAJAT] UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED
(
[CNP] ASC
)
ALTER TABLE [DBO].[ANGAJAT] DROP CONSTRAINT [LK_ANGAJAT]
 
 <strong>CHECK CONSTRAINT:</strong> MAKES SURE THAT ALL VALUES IN A COLUMN SATISFY CERTAIN CRITERIA.
 
ALTER TABLE [DBO].[ANGAJAT] ADD CONSTRAINT [CK_ANGAJAT_CASATORIT] CHECK
(([CASATORIT]=(1) OR [CASATORIT]=(2)))
ALTER TABLE [DBO].[ANGAJAT
ADD CONSTRAINT [CK_PERSON] CHECK (P_ID>0 AND CITY='SANDNES')
ALTER TABLE [DBO].[ANGAJAT] DROP CONSTRAINT [CK_ANGAJAT_CASATORIT]
 
 <strong>PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINT:</strong> USED TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY A ROW IN THE TABLE
 
ALTER TABLE [DBO].[ANGAJAT] ADD CONSTRAINT [PK_ANGAJAT] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED
( [ID] ASC
) ALTER TABLE ANGAJAT DROP CONSTRAINT PK_ANGAJAT
 
 <strong>FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT:</strong> USED TO ENSURE REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY OF THE DATA
 
ALTER TABLE ANGAJAT ADD CONSTRAINT [FK_ ANGAJAT_LOCALITATE]
(LOCALITATE_ID) REFERENCES LOCALITATE (ID_LOCALITATE)
 
 ## SQL SYNTAX CONVETION
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BvRS9xc1/Untitled.png">
 
 ## SQL STATEMENT SELECT
 
 <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/RFdyctCD/1.png">
 
### SYNTAX:
 
SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] column1[,column2] [,*]
 
FROM table1[,table2]
 
[WHERE <conditions>]
 
[GROUP BY <column-list>]
 
[HAVING <conditions>]
 
[ORDER BY <column-list> [ASC | DESC] ]
 
### EXAMPLES:
 
#### RETURNS ALL COLUMNS FOR ALL RECORDS FROM EMPLOYEES TABLE
 
SELECT *
 
FROM EMPLOYEES
 

#### RETURNS COLUMN LASTNAME FOR ALL RECORDS FROM EMPLOYEES TABLE
 
SELECT LASTNAME
 
FROM EMPLOYEES

#### RETURNS THE COLUMNS LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, TITLE FOR ALL RECORDS FROM EMPLOYEES TABLE 
 
SELECT LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, TITLE
 
FROM EMPLOYEES
 
### ALL KEYWORD:
 
SELECT ALL COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]
 
FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
#### SELECTS ALL RECORDS FROM TABLES, INCLUDING THE DUPLICATE. IT INDICATES THAT YOU DON’T WANT TO ELIMINATE DUPLICATE RECORDS. ALL KEYWORD IS DEFAULT – IT DOESN’T NEED TO BE WRITTEN.
 
### DISTINCT KEYWORD:
 
SELECT DISTINCT COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]
 
FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
#### SELECTS ONLY THE DISTINCT RECORDS FROM TABLES. IT ELIMINATES THE DUPLICATE RECORDS.IF YOU USE 2 COLUMNS, THAN THE PAIR [COLUMN1,COLUMN2] IS CONSIDER TO BE DISTINCT.
 
### ALIAS
 
 #### COLUMN ALIAS
 
 IT IS USED TO REORGANIZE OR REFORMAT THE OUTPUT AND IT MAKES THE OUTPUT MORE MEANINGFUL.
 
SELECT COLUMN1 AS COLUMNNAME1[,COLUMN2 AS COLUMNNAME2]
 
FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
EXAMPLE : SELECT LASTNAME AS PRENUME
FROM EMPLOYEES
 
#### TABLE ALIAS:
 
IT IS USED WHEN YOU ADDRESS A TABLE MULTIPLE TIMES IN A SINGLE SQL SELECT STATEMENT OR WHEN YOU WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER TO WRITE AND MAINTAIN THE LENGTHY QUERY.
 
SELECT COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]
 
FROM TABLE1 AS TABLENAME1[,TABLE2 AS TABLENAME2]
 
### WHERE CLAUSE:
 
 <img src = "https://i.postimg.cc/VNVD1F61/2.png">
 
 
SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]
 
FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
[WHERE <CONDITIONS>]
 
* SQL WHERE CLAUSE IS USED WITH OTHER SQL STATEMENTS SUCH AS SQL DELETE AND SQL UPDATE STATEMENTS TO FILTER ALL DATA ROWS IN DATABASE TABLES WHICH SATISFY ROW
CONDITION.
* A SEARCH CONDITION IS A COMBINATION OF ONE OR MORE PREDICATES THAT USE THE LOGICAL OPERATORS AND, OR, AND NO
 
 ## BASIC OPERATORS
 
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ryvzBRN4/Untitled.png">
 
  <img src = "https://i.postimg.cc/0jfS58fm/3.png">
  
  <img src = "https://i.postimg.cc/XY0M64Px/4.png">
  
 
### IN OPERATOR:
 
#### IT USED TO DETERMINE IF A VALUE IS CONTAINED IN A SET OF VALUES. THE SYNTAX OF USING SQL IN OPERATOR IS AS FOLLOWS:
 
SELECT COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]
 
FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
[WHERE COLUMN1 IN (VALUE1[, VALUE2[, VALUE3]])
 
 
### BETWEEN OPERATOR:
 
#### IT IS USED TO RETRIEVE RECORDS WHICH HAVE VALUE IN A RANGE OF VALUES. THE VALUES CAN BE NUMBERS, TEXT, OR DATES.
 
THE SYNTAX OF SQL BETWEEN IS AS FOLLOWS:
 
SELECT COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]
 
FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
WHERE COLUMN1 BETWEEN LOWER_VALUE AND UPPER_VALUE
 
### LIKE OPERATOR:
 
* WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'
* Finds any values that start with "a"
* WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'
* Finds any values that end with "a"
* WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'
* Finds any values that have "or" in any position
* WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'
* Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
* WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%_%'
* Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
* WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'
* Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"
 
#### IT IS USED TO SEARCH FOR A SPECIFIED PATTERN IN A COLUMN. TWO WILDCARD CHARACTERS ARE USED TO CONSTRUCT PATTERNS. THEY ARE PERCENTAGE
(%) AND UNDERSCORE (_).
 
1. PERCENTAGE (% ) WILDCARD ALLOWS YOU TO MATCH A SEQUENCE OF ANY CHARACTERS
INCLUDING SPACE.
 
2. UNDERSCORE ( _ ) WILDCARD ALLOWS YOU TO MATCH ANY SINGLE CHARACTER.
 
#### THE SYNTAX OF SQL LIKE IS USUALLY AS FOLLOWS:
 
SELECT COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]

FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
WHERE COLUMN1 LIKE PATTERN
 
#### ESCAPE:
 
SELECT COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]
 
FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
WHERE COLUMN1 LIKE PATTERN [ ESCAPE ESCAPE_CHARACTER ]
 
ESCAPE_CHARACTER IS A CHARACTER THAT IS PUT IN FRONT OF A WILDCARD CHARACTER TO INDICATE THAT THE WILDCARD SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS A REGULAR CHARACTER AND NOT
AS A WILDCARD.
 
ESCAPE_CHARACTER IS A CHARACTER EXPRESSION THAT HAS NO DEFAULT AND MUST EVALUATE TO ONLY ONE CHARACTER.
 
EXAMPLE: LIKE '%30!%%' ESCAPE '!‘ - SEARCH THE TEXT 30%
 
#### IS NULL OPERATOR:
 
IT IS USED TO SELECT THE RECORDS THAT HAVE IN THE SPECIFIED COLUMN A NULL VALUE.
 
SELECT COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]
 
FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
WHERE COLUMN1 IS NULL
 
#### IS NOT NULL OPERATOR:
 
IT IS USED TO SELECT THE RECORDS THAT HAVE IN THE SPECIFIED COLUMN A VALUE DIFFERENT FROM NULL.
 
SELECT COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]
 
FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
WHERE COLUMN1 IS NOT NULL
 
#### TOP CLAUSE:
 
IT IS USED TO SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF RECORDS TO RETURN. THE TOP CLAUSE CAN BE VERY USEFUL ON LARGE TABLES WITH THOUSANDS OF RECORDS. RETURNING A LARGE NUMBER OF RECORDS CAN IMPACT ON PERFORMANCE.
 
SELECT TOP (EXPRESSION) [PERCENT] COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]
 
FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
PERCENT INDICATES THAT THE QUERY RETURNS ONLY THE FIRST EXPRESSION PERCENT OF ROWS FROM THE RESULT SET.
 
#### ORDER BY KEYWORD:
 
IT IS USED TO SORT THE RECORDS RETURNED BY THE SPECIFIED COLUMNS. THE ORDER BY KEYWORD SORTS THE RECORDS IN ASCENDING ORDER BY DEFAULT.
 
SELECT COLUMN1[,COLUMN2]
 
FROM TABLE1[,TABLE2]
 
ORDER BY SORT_KEY1 [ASC | DESC] [,SORT_KEY2 [ASC | DESC]]
 
##  SQL Wildcards Examples
 
* selects all Customers with a City starting with "ber" 
 
SELECT * FROM Customers
 
WHERE City LIKE 'ber%‘
 
* selects all Customers with a City containing the pattern "es"
 
SELECT * FROM Customers
 
WHERE City LIKE '%es%‘

* selects all Customers with a City starting with any character, followed by "erlin"
 
SELECT * FROM Customers  
 
WHERE City LIKE '_erlin‘
 
* selects all Customers with a City with "L", followed by any character, followed by "n", followed by any
character, followed by "on"
 
SELECT * FROM Customers
 
WHERE City LIKE 'L_n_on’

* selects all Customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p"
 
SELECT * FROM Customers
 
WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%‘
 
* selects all Customers with a City starting with "a", "b", or "c“
  
SELECT * FROM Customers
 
WHERE City LIKE '[a-c]%‘
 
* select all Customers with a City NOT starting with "b", "s", or "p“
 
SELECT * FROM Customers
 
WHERE City LIKE '[!bsp]%‘

## INSERT 
 
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L89nBV02/8.png">
 
* INSERT INTO Statement
* It is used to insert a new row in a table.
* SQL INSERT INTO Syntax
* It is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two forms.
 
#### The first form doesn't specify the column names where the data will be inserted,
only their values:
 
 INSERT INTO table1
 
 VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...)
 
#### The second form specifies both the column names and the values to be inserted:
 
 INSERT INTO table1 (column1, column2…)
 
 VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...)
 
 
####  Most common errors:
 
* type mismatch
* value not inserted in a not null column
* constraints errors
* foreign key values don’t match
 
## UPDATE
 
<img src = "https://i.postimg.cc/W3WnT3FJ/9.png">
 
 
#### It is used to update existing records in a table.
 
 #### Syntax:
 
UPDATE table1
 
SET column1 = value1,
 
column2 = value2, …
 
WHERE condition
 
#### Note:
 
* Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE syntax. The WHERE clause specifies which record or records should be updated.
* If you omit the WHERE clause, all records will be updated!
 
  ## DELETE/TRUNCATE
 
 <img src = "https://i.postimg.cc/Y2L5WSN7/1.png">
 
* It is used to delete rows in a table.
 
#### Syntax:
 
DELETE FROM table1
 
WHERE condition
 
#### Note:
 
* Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE syntax. The WHERE clause specifies which
record or records should be deleted.
* If you omit the WHERE clause, all records will be deleted!
 
 #### Most common error:
* Delete a row that contains a value that is foreign key in another table.
 
 <strong>SQL TRUNCATE</strong> statement is used to delete all data from a table without a WHERE clause.
* The logic inside SQL TRUNCATE statement is that: SQL TRUNCATE statement drops the table and recreate it again. This way is much faster than deleting rows one by one in some RDBMSs. (relational database management system)
 
#### Syntax:
 
 TRUNCATE TABLE table1
