<summary>About me</summary>

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as electronic enginner and manual tester. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.I believe that so far I have formed a knowledge base, a way of thinking, which will help me to progress in my career in the future.
I am a punctual person with good communication skills, as a result I integrate extremely easily in a group. I like to learn different new things, to apply them and I can say that I am one of the people oriented towards evolution, progress, everything acquired through the accumulation of knowledge and skills.
I like to respond to the challenge of new situations and I am convinced that I will be able to successfully meet the requirements of the job, because I am a dynamic, creative person, with a strategic and  communicative thinking.
If you consider that I am a candidate who meets the requirements for the position offered, I expect you to contact me by e-mail or telephone number to determine the details of our future collaboration.
