I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as electronic enginner and manual tester. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.I believe that so far I have formed a knowledge base, a way of thinking, which will help me to progress in my career in the future.
I am a punctual person with good communication skills, as a result I integrate extremely easily in a group. I like to learn different new things, to apply them and I can say that I am one of the people oriented towards evolution, progress, everything acquired through the accumulation of knowledge and skills.
I like to respond to the challenge of new situations and I am convinced that I will be able to successfully meet the requirements of the job, because I am a dynamic, creative person, with a strategic and  communicative thinking.
If you consider that I am a candidate who meets the requirements for the position offered, I expect you to contact me by e-mail or telephone number to determine the details of our future collaboration.

 # Variables. Data Types 
 
 <picture>
 <img alt="Step By Step Toward The Goal"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/28KSLy6T/Screenshot-1.png">
 </picture>
 
 * python variables are the containers that we store data values in them
 * when we assing this value, the variable is automatically created
 * we can assign a number, a string, a list, a tuple, a set, a dictionary  to python variables
 * we can change the value of a variable multiple times in our code
 * while we assign a value to the variables, if it is the same value, we can do this in one line
 * variables can be overwritten
 * data types are properties of variables, functions or methods that instruct the system about the stored value (for variables) or the returned result (for functions and    methods)

## Basic rules for naming variables:

* it must start with a lowercase letter
* it must not have spaces - if the variable name consists of several words, then the variable name can follow the camelCase or snake_case format
* it must not start with numbers
* it must not start with special characters

# Operators
 
 ## There are different python operators. We can divide them into seven categories like below:
 
  
 * Arithmetic operators
 * Assignment operators
 * Comparison operators
 * Logical operators
 * Identity operators
 * Membership operators
 * Bitwise operators
 
 ##  Arithmetic operators
 <picture>

 </picture>
 
 ## Assignment operators
 
 <picture>
 <img alt="Step By Step Toward The Goal"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/pX81VNbr/Screenshot-1.png">
 </picture>
 
 ## Comparison operators
 
 <picture>
 <img alt="Step By Step Toward The Goal"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/Jtw63xJR/Screenshot-1.png">
 </picture>
 
 ## Logical operators
 
 ### To combine conditional statements, we use python logical operators. There are three logical operators in python. These are:
 
 * and operator returns True, if both statements are true
 * or operator returns True, if one of the statements is true
 * not operator reverse the result, returns False if the result is true

 </picture>
 
 
 ## Identity operators
 
 ### Python Identity Operators are the operators that are used to compare the objects. This is not only a comparison about their value, but also their location in the memory. These operators check that if they are the same object or not. Below, you can find these Python Identity Operators
 
 * is operator checks that if both objects are the same object. If yes, it returns True
 * is not operator checks that if both objects are different objects. If yes, it returns True

 </picture>
 
 
 ## Membership operators
 
 ### Python Membership Operators are used to check the members of a sequence. To do this, it uses two operators:
 
 * in operator returns True, if it finds the value as a member in the sequence
 * not in operator return True, if it do not find the value as a members in the sequence

 </picture>
 
 
 ## Bitwise operators
 
 ### Lastly, we will talk about Bitwise operators of python. These operators are used to compare binary numbers in python programming
 
 * & AND   - Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
 * | OR    - Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
 * ^ XOR   -  Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 
 * ~ NOT   -  Inverts all the bits
 * '<<' Zero fill left shift  - Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
 * '>>' Signed right shift  - Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
 
 
 # Conditionals
 
 <picture>
 <img alt="Step By Step Toward The Goal"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/fTSYSFs9/Screenshot-1.png">
 </picture>
 
 * in Python one of the most used statements is Python If Else or Python Else If statements
 * with these statements we check special conditions and according to this condition, we do something
 * the usage of this statements can be differently like below
 
 ## We can only use if statement :

 <picture>
 <img alt="Step By Step Toward The Goal"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/N0pRh2m6/Screenshot-2.png">

 ## Using And / Or Operators with Python If Else 
 
 * sometimes we need to check one more condition in the if statements(there are two operators that we us efor this purposes, one of them is “and”, the other one is “or”)
 * with “and” operator, we check the given conditions and if both the conditions are provided, then the body of the if statement runs
 * with “or” operator, we check the given conditions and if one of them is provided, then the body of the if statament runs

 ## Nested If Statements
 
 * nested If Statements are the if statemetns used in another if statements
 * we can use multiple if statements inside another if statements

 # Lists. Tuples. Dictionaries. Sets.
 
 
 ## Lists
 
 * list is created with a Square Brackets []
 * the items belong to this list is added into these square brackets with commas (,)
 * list items are ordered(items have a defined order, and that order will not change) 
 * list items are changeable(we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created)
 * allow duplicate values(since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value)
 * list items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
