<summary>About me</summary>

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as electronic enginner and manual tester. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.I believe that so far I have formed a knowledge base, a way of thinking, which will help me to progress in my career in the future.
I am a punctual person with good communication skills, as a result I integrate extremely easily in a group. I like to learn different new things, to apply them and I can say that I am one of the people oriented towards evolution, progress, everything acquired through the accumulation of knowledge and skills.
I like to respond to the challenge of new situations and I am convinced that I will be able to successfully meet the requirements of the job, because I am a dynamic, creative person, with a strategic and  communicative thinking.
If you consider that I am a candidate who meets the requirements for the position offered, I expect you to contact me by e-mail or telephone number to determine the details of our future collaboration.

 #### 1. Evaluate Situation
  
 * the components of the system to be tested are defined as “in scope“ -  Functional Testing, Api Testing
 * the components of the system that will not be tested also need to be clearly defined as being “out of scope.” -  Database Testing, hardware & any other external interfaces
 
 #### 2.  Identify Testing Type

 #### 3. Document Risk & Issues
 
 |Risk   | 	Mitigation  |
|-----:|---------------|
| Team member lack the required skills for website testing     |      Plan training course to skill up your members          |
|     The project schedule is too tight; it’s hard to complete this project on time |     Set test priority for each of the test activity        |
|    A lack of cooperation negatively affects your employees’ productivity   |      Encourage each team member in his task, and inspire them to greater efforts.       |
 |     Wrong budget estimate and cost overruns |          Establish the scope before beginning work, pay a lot of attention to project planning and constantly track and measure the progress    |

 #### 4. Create Test Logistics

 ##### 4.1 Who will test ?   
 
 * ability to understand customers point of view
 * strong desire for quality

  ###  Define Test Objective
  
  * checking that whether website  functionality is working as expected without any error or bugs in real business environment
  * check that the external interface of the website such as UI is working as expected and & meet the customer need
  * verify the usability of the website
 
 ### Define Test Criteria
 
 ####  Entry Criteria - definition on done
 ####  Exit Criteria - definition on ready

 ## Test Analysis & Design
  
   * reviewing the test basis (such as requirements, software integrity level1(risk level), risk analysis reports, architecture, design, interface specifications)
   * evaluating testability of the test basis and test objects
   * identifying and prioritizing test conditions based on analysis of test items, the specification, behavior and structure of the software
   * designing and prioritizing high level test cases
   * identifying necessary test data to support the test conditions and test cases
   * designing the test environment setup and identifying any required infrastructure and tools
   * creating bi-directional traceability between test basis and test cases

 ## Test Implementations
 
 * ensuring that the test environment is in place
 * ensuring every test case is well documented and reviewed
 * putting test environment in a state of readiness
 * checking against explicit and implicit entry criteria for the specified test level
 * describing test environment as well as test data in great detail
 * performing code acceptance check by running it on test environment
 
 
  ## Test Executation
 
  * PASS: test procedure is executed and the expected result is satisfied
  * FAIL: test procedure is executed and the expected result is not satisfied
  * INCONCLUSIVE: test procedure is executed and requires further analysis to have a clear result
  * BLOCK: test procedure cannot be executed due to the fact that at least one of the test case preconditions are not met
  * DEFERED: test procedure is not executed yet and deferred for a future test cycle/release for execution
  * IN PROGRESS: test procedure is currently being executed
