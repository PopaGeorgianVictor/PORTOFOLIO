<summary>About me</summary>

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as electronic enginner and manual tester. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.I believe that so far I have formed a knowledge base, a way of thinking, which will help me to progress in my career in the future.
I am a punctual person with good communication skills, as a result I integrate extremely easily in a group. I like to learn different new things, to apply them and I can say that I am one of the people oriented towards evolution, progress, everything acquired through the accumulation of knowledge and skills.
I like to respond to the challenge of new situations and I am convinced that I will be able to successfully meet the requirements of the job, because I am a dynamic, creative person, with a strategic and  communicative thinking.
If you consider that I am a candidate who meets the requirements for the position offered, I expect you to contact me by e-mail or telephone number to determine the details of our future collaboration.

 ### Analize the product
       
 * Who will use the website ?
 * What is it used for ?
 * How will it work ?
 * What are software/ hardware the product uses ?

 ###  Develop Test Strategy

</picture>
 
 
 #### 1. Evaluate Situation
  
 * the components of the system to be tested are defined as “in scope“ -  Functional Testing, Api Testing
 * the components of the system that will not be tested also need to be clearly defined as being “out of scope.” -  Database Testing, hardware & any other external interfaces
 
 #### 2.  Identify Testing Type

 #### 3. Document Risk & Issues
 
 |Risk   | 	Mitigation  |
|-----:|---------------|
| Team member lack the required skills for website testing     |      Plan training course to skill up your members          |
|     The project schedule is too tight; it’s hard to complete this project on time |     Set test priority for each of the test activity        |
|    A lack of cooperation negatively affects your employees’ productivity   |      Encourage each team member in his task, and inspire them to greater efforts.       |
 |     Wrong budget estimate and cost overruns |          Establish the scope before beginning work, pay a lot of attention to project planning and constantly track and measure the progress    |

 #### 4. Create Test Logistics

 ##### 4.1 Who will test ?   
 
 * ability to understand customers point of view
 * strong desire for quality
 * attention to detail
 * good cooperation
 
 ##### 4.2 When will the test occur ?

  ###  Define Test Objective
  
  * checking that whether website  functionality is working as expected without any error or bugs in real business environment
  * check that the external interface of the website such as UI is working as expected and & meet the customer need
  * verify the usability of the website
 
 ### Define Test Criteria
 
 ####  Entry Criteria - definition on done
 ####  Exit Criteria - definition on ready

 ## Test Analysis & Design
  
   * reviewing the test basis (such as requirements, software integrity level1(risk level), risk analysis reports, architecture, design, interface specifications)
   * evaluating testability of the test basis and test objects
   * identifying and prioritizing test conditions based on analysis of test items, the specification, behavior and structure of the software
   * designing and prioritizing high level test cases
   * identifying necessary test data to support the test conditions and test cases
   * designing the test environment setup and identifying any required infrastructure and tools
   * creating bi-directional traceability between test basis and test cases

 ## Test Implementations
 
 * ensuring that the test environment is in place
 * ensuring every test case is well documented and reviewed
 * putting test environment in a state of readiness
 * checking against explicit and implicit entry criteria for the specified test level
 * describing test environment as well as test data in great detail
 * performing code acceptance check by running it on test environment
 
 
  ## Test Executation
 
  * PASS: test procedure is executed and the expected result is satisfied
  * FAIL: test procedure is executed and the expected result is not satisfied
  * INCONCLUSIVE: test procedure is executed and requires further analysis to have a clear result
  * BLOCK: test procedure cannot be executed due to the fact that at least one of the test case preconditions are not met
  * DEFERED: test procedure is not executed yet and deferred for a future test cycle/release for execution
  * IN PROGRESS: test procedure is currently being executed

 ## Variables. Data Types 
 
 <picture>
 <img alt="Step By Step Toward The Goal"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/28KSLy6T/Screenshot-1.png">
 </picture>
 
 * python variables are the containers that we store data values in them
 * when we assing this value, the variable is automatically created
 * we can assign a number, a string, a list, a tuple, a set, a dictionary  to python variables
 * we can change the value of a variable multiple times in our code
 * while we assign a value to the variables, if it is the same value, we can do this in one line
 * variables can be overwritten
 * data types are properties of variables, functions or methods that instruct the system about the stored value (for variables) or the returned result (for functions and    methods)

### Basic rules for naming variables:

* it must start with a lowercase letter
* it must not have spaces - if the variable name consists of several words, then the variable name can follow the camelCase or snake_case format
* it must not start with numbers
* it must not start with special characters

## Operators
 
 ### There are different python operators. We can divide them into seven categories like below:
 
  
 * Arithmetic operators
 * Assignment operators
 * Comparison operators
 * Logical operators
 * Identity operators
 * Membership operators
 * Bitwise operators
 
 ###  Arithmetic operators

 ### Assignment operators

 ### Comparison operators

 ### Logical operators
 
 #### To combine conditional statements, we use python logical operators. There are three logical operators in python. These are:
 
 * and operator returns True, if both statements are true
 * or operator returns True, if one of the statements is true
 * not operator reverse the result, returns False if the result is true

 ### Identity operators
 
 #### Python Identity Operators are the operators that are used to compare the objects. This is not only a comparison about their value, but also their location in the memory. These operators check that if they are the same object or not. Below, you can find these Python Identity Operators
 
 * is operator checks that if both objects are the same object. If yes, it returns True
 * is not operator checks that if both objects are different objects. If yes, it returns True
